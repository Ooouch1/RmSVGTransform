# RmSVGTransform
This software is for reducing transform attribute of svg objects (as possible).
The motivation is to help making inkscape-svg compatible to Adobe Illustlator.
Although there are some tricks for the compability,
the different treatment of transform attribute is really annoying: you should not enlarge grouped objects in inkscape!

## Developer Environment
* Ruby 2.3.2
	* gem install test-unit-rr
