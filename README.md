# RmSVGTransform
This software is for reducing transform attribute of svg objects (as possible).
The motivation is to help making inkscape-svg compatible to Adobe Illustlator.
Input svg is limited one that is a plain svg saved by inkscape so far.

Although there are some tricks for the compability,
the different treatment of transform attribute is really annoying: you should not enlarge grouped objects in inkscape!
